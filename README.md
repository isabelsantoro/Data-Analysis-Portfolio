## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Taylor Swift Audio Features
**Code:** [`Taylor Swift - Spotify API - Extraction of Audio Features and Popularity.ipynb`((https://github.com/isabelsantoro/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/3b4eb493e263705bcf7e8b276c691a9ab5043e6e/audio_features_spotify_API.ipynb)   
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.
