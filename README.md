# Spotify-API-project
Audio Features and Popularity extraction and analysis

In this project, I used the Spotify For Developers API and Python to extract the audio features and popularity of each track from every Taylor Swift album. Subsequently, I created a visualization dashboard of this data in Tableau, where it is possible to filter the audio features and popularity based on the selected album.
