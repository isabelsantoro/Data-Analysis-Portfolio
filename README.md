# Data Analysis Portfolio - Isabel Santoro

## About
Hi, I'm Isabel Santoro! I hold a degree in Mobility Engineering, and throughout my academic journey, I had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of data analysis, including statistics, machine learning, and more. During my studies, I applied these skills to the field of mobility and transportation, leveraging data to gain insights and optimize transportation systems.

In addition, I had the privilege of developing my master's thesis within a company, focusing on the mobility domain. Specifically, my thesis involved analyzing data from a newly implemented electronic ticketing system. This involved monitoring its progress, extracting valuable insights, and providing recommendations for service improvement.

The experience of working on a real-world project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in handling and analyzing large datasets, understanding the intricacies of mobility systems, and deriving meaningful conclusions to drive positive change.

However, my passion for data analysis extended beyond the realm of mobility. I found myself exploring and applying these concepts to diverse domains, driven by personal interests. This continuous exploration has allowed me to discover the power of data analysis in various contexts, expanding my knowledge and skill set.

<br>
In this constantly evolving portfolio, I aim to document and showcase the projects I undertake. This portfolio serves as a comprehensive record of my progress and achievements, demonstrating my growth as a data analyst and highlighting the diverse range of topics I've had the pleasure of exploring.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Taylor Swift Audio Features
**Code:** [`audio_features_spotify_API.ipynb`](https://github.com/isabelsantoro/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/3b4eb493e263705bcf7e8b276c691a9ab5043e6e/audio_features_spotify_API.ipynb)  
**Tableau Dashboard:** [`Taylor Swift's Audio Features`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/isabel.santoro/viz/TaylorSwiftsAudioFeatures/Dashboard)   
**Description:** In this project, I utilized the Spotify For Developers API to extract data regarding the audio features and popularity of each song from Taylor Swift's main albums. The project focuses on providing a comprehensive understanding of the dataset by presenting the information through a Tableau visualization. The visualization incorporates all the necessary details to comprehend the characteristics of the utilized dataset.  
**Skills:** data visualization, API querying to retrieve the desired information.  
**Technology:** Python, Tableau  
**Results:** Review of the main charachteristics of the sound of each track.
